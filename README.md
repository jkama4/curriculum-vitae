# Jayden Kashani Maleki - CV

## Introduction
As you can tell, I am Jayden Kashani Maleki, a 20-years-old student Artificial Intelligence at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I enjoy studying AI concepts, and working out problems to try and solve them. For some reason I have a passion for math. Before I started studying AI, I studied Applied Mathematics at the TU Delft for about 6 months. Besides studying, I also work (part-time) as a developer. I mainly build APIs to enhance infrastructure within the company I work for.

That was a short summary about me. In the remainder of the CV you'll find a detailed description of my experience.

## Academic Experience
- VWO - I finished VWO with a technical profile, namely N&T (which literally translates to Nature & Technology). My grades can be found in the provided documents on GitHub. 
- TU Delft - Here, I studied Applied Mathematics. Unfortunately, I quit the study early since it wasn't in line with my expectations. I did get a good grasp of deeper understanding of difficult mathematical concepts.
- Vrije Universiteit - The university where I study currently. I am enjoying my studies since the first moment I arrived here. I study many theories of mathematics, such as linear algebra, calculus, logic, set theory, probability, statistics, and machine learning. A better overview of the courses/study content can be found in the provided documents on GitHub

## Work Experience
- [Kompas Publishing B.V.](https://www.kompaspublishing.nl/) - The company I currently work at as a developer. I develop LLM-powered APIs that utilise existing data to generate new insights or structured outputs. These outputs enrich internal tools with additional functionality and data dimensions. I mainly work with Python. However, I also have to deal with other programming languages, and reviews code.
